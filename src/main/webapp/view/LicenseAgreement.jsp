(iii) Disclose, provide, or otherwise make available trade secrets contained within the Software and Documentation in any form to any third party without the prior written consent of SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS. Customer shall implement reasonable security measures to protect such trade secrets.

To the extent required by law, and at Customer's written request, SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS shall provide Customer with the interface information needed to achieve interoperability between the Software and another independently created program, on payment of SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS' applicable fee, if any. Customer shall observe strict obligations of confidentiality with respect to such information and shall use such information in compliance with any applicable terms and conditions upon which SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS makes such information available.

(i) Use or permit the Software to be used to perform services for third parties, whether on a service bureau or time sharing basis;

Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control. All confidentiality obligations of Customer and all limitations of liability and disclaimers and restrictions of warranty shall survive termination of this Agreement. In addition, the provisions of the section titled
'General Terms Applicable to the Limited Warranty Statement and End User License' shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Export: Software and Documentation, including technical data, may be subject to U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its associated regulations, and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. Customer agrees to comply strictly with all such regulations and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import Software and Documentation.

Limited Warranty
Subject to the limitations and conditions set forth herein, SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS warrants that commencing from the date of shipment to Customer (but in case of resale by an authorized SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS reseller, commencing not more than thirty (30) days after original shipment by SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS), and continuing for a period of ten (10) months: (a) the media on which the Software is furnished will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use; and (b) the Software substantially conforms to the Documentation. The date of shipment of the Software by SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS is set forth on the packaging material in which the Software is shipped. Except for the foregoing, the Software is provided AS IS. This limited warranty extends only to the Customer who is the original licensee. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS and its suppliers and licensors under this limited warranty will be (i) replacement of defective media and/or (ii) at SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS's option, repair, replacement, or refund of the purchase price of the Software, in both cases subject to the condition that any error or defect constituting a breach of this limited warranty is reported to SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS or the party supplying the Software to Customer, if different than SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS, within the warranty period.

SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS or the party supplying the Software to Customer may, at its option, require return of the Software as a condition to the remedy. Because of the unique nature of the algorithms and methodologies provided in the Software, Customer acknowledges that SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS has incorporated protection measures against any form of non-licensed use of the Software or parts thereof. Customer agrees that the Software is provided with a hardware protection key (dongle) which is required to run the Software and any of its applications. IT IS THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY OF CUSTOMER TO PROTECT THE DONGLE ADEQUATELY AND SECURE IT AGAINST LOSS AND DISAPPEARANCE. CUSTOMER WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO OBTAIN A REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE UNLESS THE ORIGINAL HARD DISK IS DEFECTIVE AND IS RETURNED TO SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BY A TRACKABLE COURIER SERVICE. NOTE: For evaluation or beta copies for which SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS does not charge a license fee, the Software may not be protected by means of a software replacement but using a license negotiated with an SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS Internet server.

In no event does SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS warrant that the Software is error free or that Customer will be able to operate the Software without problems or interruptions.

Restrictions: This warranty does not apply if the Software (a) has been altered, except by SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS or its authorized representative, (b) has not been installed, operated, or maintained in accordance with instructions supplied by SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS, or (c) is licensed, for beta, evaluation, testing or demonstration purposes for which SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS does not charge a purchase price or license fee.

JURISDICTION. This disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty set forth above fails of its essential purpose.

General Terms Applicable to the Limited Warranty Statement and End User License. Disclaimer of Liabilities: REGARDLESS WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE, IN NO EVENT WILL SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT, OR LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF CAPITAL, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY OR WHETHER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE AND EVEN IF SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event shall SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS's or its suppliers' or licensors' liability to Customer, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of warranty, or otherwise, exceed the price paid by Customer for the Software that gave rise to the claim. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Customer agrees that the limitations of liability and disclaimers set forth herein will apply regardless of whether Customer has accepted the Software or any other product or service delivered by SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS. Customer acknowledges and agrees that SUNRAYS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS has set its prices and entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of liability set forth herein, that the same reflect an allocation of risk between the parties (including the risk that a contract remedy may fail of its essential purpose and cause consequential loss), and that the same form an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.

The Warranty and the End User License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Indian Law without reference to or application of choice of law rules or principles. If any portion hereof is found to be void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the license of the Software and Documentation and supersedes any conflicting or additional terms contained in any purchase order or elsewhere, all of which terms are excluded.
